        <h2><a name="introduction">What's in the database?</a></h2>
        <p>The database <em>Hymn melodies. Danish reformation hymns 1529-1573</em> holds the melodies included in
            the Danish hymn and service books published online at  
            <a href="https://salmer.dsl.dk" target="_blank" titel="Digital edition of the hymn books">salmer.dsl.dk</a>.<br/>
            The database is intended to illustrate relations between the melodies involved. Apart from the notated melodies 
            themselves the database informs about their transmission and use during the 16th century. 
            References to further reading and links to other digital resources provide access to further information.</p>
        <p>Various types of database records describe the material at different levels. Record types and internal links 
            are colour-coded as follows to guide the user:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><span class="relation music_document">Melody in a publication</span></td>

                    If the melody does not occur in any other book within the edited corpus,
                    also historical information about the melody is given at this level.

                    describing the melody as found in each of the books.<br/>
                    The various notations of the melody are shown as well for easy comparison.</td>

        <h2><a name="notation">Interacting with scores</a></h2>
        
        <p><img style="float:right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" src="/style/img/menu_en.png" title="Music menu" alt="Music menu"/>The 
            menu icon <img src="/style/img/menu_icon.png" title="Menu" alt="Menu" width="26"/> next to each melody
            offers various kinds of interaction with the score:</p>
        
        <h3><a name="play">Playback</a></h3>
        <p>Click the <img src="/style/img/play.png" title="Play" alt="Play"/> (play) button to listen to the melody.
            Notes are highlighted during playback to facilitate following the score.</p>
        
        <h3><a name="midi">MIDI download</a></h3>
        <p>Melodies are downloadable in MIDI format for playback locally on the user's computer or other devices.
            Click the MIDI icon <img src="/style/img/midi.svg" title="MIDI download" alt="MIDI"/> in the melody menu 
            to download.<br/>
            This feature is available only in the melody database, not in the digital edition of the books.</p>
        
        <h3><a name="notation">Modifying the notation</a></h3>
        
        <h4><a name="clef">Clefs</a></h4>
        <p>The melodies are often notated using clefs unfamiliar to many readers today. To improve readability, the 
            clefs may be substituted for more current ones: G clef, octave-transposing G clef ("vocal tenor clef") or bass clef.
            Click the desired clef in the music menu to change.
        </p>
        
        <h4><a name="duration">Note values</a></h4>
        <p>The hymn and service books present the melodies using obsolescent forms of notation —
            square notation (rectangular, stemless noteheads), mensural notation or a hybrid form of both.
            Mensural notation resembles modern notation ("Common Western Notation", CWN), and the digital edition 
            presents them using their equivalent modern note shapes.    
            To the modern reader, the resulting long note values may be unfamiliar or misleadingly suggest a very slow tempo. 
            To align the notation with current notational practice, note values may be diminished to half or a quarter of their
            original length in the music menu.<br/>
            Please note: Reducing the note values causes the mensuration sign (corresponding to what would be seen as a
            "time signature" in modern notation) at the beginning to change colour to red, reminding the user that it is not to be
            understood as a time signature in the modern sense, but as a mensuration sign, which is not readily diminishable
            and therefore will be misleading in the context of diminished note values.
        </p>
        
        <h4><a name="transposition">Transposition</a></h4>
        <p>The music menu allows transposing the melodies up or down as required. 
            The playback feature reflects the current transposition.</p>
        
        <h2><a name="search">Searching</a></h2>
        <p> </p>
        
        <h3><a name="search_title">Title search</a></h3>
        <p>Searching melodies by title is available on all pages by clicking the search icon  
            <img src="/style/img/search.png" title="Søgning" alt="Søgning"/> in the upper right corner of the page. <br/>
            Enter a title or part of a title in the search field or choose one from the expandable list below it.
            Titles may be entered using original or modernised orthography. 
        </p>
        
        <h3><a name="advanced">Melodic search</a></h3> 
        <p>From the melody databases' search page also the music is searchable. 
            The search page is available at <a href="mei_search.xq">https://melodier.dsl.dk/mei_search.xq</a>.
            It is also reachable from any other page by clicking "Advanced search" below the title search field.<br/>
            Due to the rhythmic variation of the melodies and the rhythmic ambiguity of some of the notational systems 
            involved, all searches are rhythmic unaware and take into account only pitch.<br/>
            The search page's tabs offer various ways of searching the melodies:</p>
        
        <h4><a name="search_pitchname">Searching by pitch name</a></h4>
        <p>Melodies are searchable using pitch names. <br/>
            Altered notes are written as <kbd>V</kbd> (C sharp/D flat), <kbd>W</kbd> (D sharp/E flat), 
            <kbd>X</kbd> (F sharp/G flat), <kbd>Y</kbd> (G sharp/A flat), and <kbd>Z</kbd> (A sharp/ B flat).</p>
        <p>EXAMPLE: <a href="https://melodier.dsl.dk/mei_search.xq?x=&amp;q=CAFACDC" title="Search for pitch sequence CAFACDC">Searching for the pitch sequence <kbd>CAFACDC</kbd></a> 
            finds the melody <em>Nu er fød os Jesus Christ / Resonet in laudibus</em> 
            (In Denmark also known today as <em>Lad det klinge sødt i sky</em>).</p>
        
        <h4><a name="search_contour">Searching by melodic contour</a></h4>
        <p>A more flexible way of searching the melodies is by specifying the contour of the melody, that is, whether the melodic 
            line is ascending (indicated by a <kbd>/</kbd>), descending (<kbd>\</kbd>) or repeating a note (<kbd>-</kbd>). 
            Alternatively, the letters <kbd>u</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>r</kbd> may be used for "up", "down", and "repeat", respectively.<br/>
            As the countour search takes into account only the direction of the intervals but is indifferent to their size,
            it yields many more results than the pitch name search. Therefore a somewhat longer query string will usually be 
            needed to limit the number of results.</p> 
        <p>EXAMPLE: <a href="https://melodier.dsl.dk/mei_search.xq?x=&amp;c=dduuudrdduuud" title="Search for the contour \\///\-\\///\">Searching for the contour <kbd>\\///\-\\///\</kbd></a> finds – as above – 
            <em>Nu er fød os Jesus Christ / Resonet in laudibus</em>.</p>
        
        <h4><a name="search_notation">Searching by notation (piano input)</a></h4>
        <p>Melodies are searchable also by means of music notation. The piano input allows sequences of 
            up to twelve notes.</p>
        <p>The search may be narrowed or broadened by a number of options: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All transpositions: Broadens the search by including results matching the note sequence in all transpositions
                (in essence, searching by intervals instead of pitches)</li>
            <li>Starts with: Narrows the search to melodies starting with the specified note sequence</li>
            <li>Ignore repeated notes: Broadens the search by treating repeated notes as one, thus enabling matches also 
                where, for instance, notes are subdivided into two or more to fit differing numbers of syllables.</li>
            <li>Precision: One or two edits (deviations) from the specified query sequence may be allowed. Missing notes, 
                added notes and altered pitches each count as one edit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EXAMPLE: <a href="https://melodier.dsl.dk/mei_search.xq?a=77-77-77-72-76-77-74-72&amp;x=&amp;e=1&amp;f=2" title="Search for: Vor Gud han er så fast en borg">Searching
            for the first eight notes of <em>Vor Gud han er så fast en borg</em></a> ("A Mighty Fortress Is Our God") in its 
            modern Danish shape requires allowing two edits, because the fifth note diverges in pitch (D instead of E) 
            and because the old form of the melody has an extra note (between F and D).</p>
        
        <p><img style="float:right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" src="/style/img/search_phrase.png" title="Marking and searching" alt="Marking"/>Melodic 
            search is also immidiately available wherever there is music notation in the digital edition of the books or 
            in the melody database: Click on a note and then on another to mark a melodic passage. Click the marked passage to 
            perform a search for similar sequences (or click on a note outside the marking to unselect).</p>
